# FabGL
### **ESP32** Display Controller (VGA, Color NTSC/PAL Composite, I2C and SPI displays), PS/2 Mouse and Keyboard Controller, Graphics Library, Sound Engine, Graphical User Interface (GUI), Game/Emulation Engine and ANSI/VT Terminal

# Warning! The latest version of the Espressif ESP32 library that FabGL runs on is *2.0.17*. Unfortunately, the latest versions of Espressif leave too little memory free for applications, and a project the size of FabGL can no longer function as intended.

FabGL is mainly a Graphics Library for ESP32. It implements several display drivers (VGA output, PAL/NTSC Color Composite, I2C and SPI displays).
FabGL can also get input from a PS/2 Keyboard and a Mouse. FabGL implements also: an Audio Engine (DAC and Sigma-Delta), a Graphical User Interface (GUI), a Game Engine and an ANSI/VT Terminal.

This library works with ESP32 revision 1 or upper. See [**Compatible Boards**][Boards].

VGA output requires a external digital to analog converter (DAC): it can be done by three 270 Ohm resistors to have 8 colors, or by 6 resistors to have 64 colors.
Composite output doesn't require external components (maybe a 5Mhz low pass filter).

There are several fixed and variable width fonts embedded.

Unlimited number of sprites are supported. However big sprites and a large amount of them reduces the frame rate and could generate flickering.

When there is enough memory (on low resolutions like 320x200), it is possible to allocate two screen buffers, so to implement double buffering.
In this case primitives are always drawn on the back buffer.

Except for double buffering or when explicitly disabled, all drawings are performed on vertical retracing, so no flickering is visible.
If the queue of primitives to draw is not processed before the vertical retracing ends, then it is interrupted and continued at next retracing.

There is a graphical user interface (GUI) with overlapping windows and mouse handling and a lot of widgets (buttons, editboxes, checkboxes, comboboxes, listboxes, etc..).

Finally, there is a sound engine, with multiple channels mixed to a mono output. Each channel can generate sine waveforms, square, etc... or custom sampled data.
